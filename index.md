# 🔍 Neural Network Log Monitoring

### A project by Jerry

## Overview
This project aims to develop a **neural network** that learns from logs stored in a database. The model will help **IT admins** detect anomalies and gain insights through a **dashboard**.

## 🛡️ What the NN Learns
- **Login anomalies** – Detects accounts logging in from different locations within an **impossible timeframe**.
- **Unusual request frequency** – Frequent requests from a single IP could indicate a **DoS attack**.
- **Distributed attacks** – Multiple IPs sending similar requests in a short time (**DDoS attack**).
- **Pattern recognition** – Extracts insights from **timestamps, IP addresses, and log descriptions**.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
Each phase is crucial for developing an effective neural network:

1️⃣ **Idea** – Identify the problem and define objectives.  
2️⃣ **Data Collection** – Gather logs from databases (**timestamps, IPs, request types**).  
3️⃣ **Preliminary Training** – Test with a small dataset to understand trends.  
4️⃣ **Data Cleaning** – Filter noise, handle missing values, and standardize log formats.  
5️⃣ **Algorithm Development** – Select an **NN architecture** (e.g., **LSTMs for sequence-based patterns**).  
6️⃣ **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimize layers, learning rates, and activation functions.  
7️⃣ **Full-scale Training** – Train with extensive real-world logs.  
8️⃣ **Deployment** – Integrate the trained model into a **dashboard** for real-time monitoring.  

## 🏗️ Next Steps
✅ Implement a **relational database** for structured logs.  
✅ Experiment with **LSTMs** and **CNNs** for anomaly detection.  
✅ Develop an **interactive dashboard** to visualize anomalies.  

💡 **Stay tuned for updates!**
