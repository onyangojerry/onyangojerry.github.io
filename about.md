# About This Project

## Why Build This?
IT security relies on **log analysis** to detect potential threats. Manually analyzing logs is inefficient, so this project **automates anomaly detection** with deep learning.

## Challenges
- **Data Volume** – Logs are massive; efficient processing is needed.
- **False Positives** – Balancing sensitivity vs. accuracy.
- **Real-time Analysis** – The model should flag anomalies quickly.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **unsupervised learning** for unknown attack patterns.
- Integrate with **real-world security tools**.
- Deploy on **cloud platforms** for scalability.
